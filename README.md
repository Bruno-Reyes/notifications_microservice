# SERVICE NOTIFICATIONS MICROSERVICE IN GOLANG

Often, we need some an automatic email sender microservice, so this is a simple solution. 

It's made using Go, because the go routines are very powerfull to manage a lot of requests this is a native way to reach it. 
At this example, I'm using Mailgun as smtp server and a domain from domains .tech
